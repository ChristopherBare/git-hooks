# Useful git-hooks

This repo was created because I always have to go find the hooks I use at every job I've ever worked at. Now they're all in one place and easy to install.

## Current hooks

- prepare-commit-message
  - prepends the JIRA story number to the beginning of the commit message based on the branch name (which usually contains the JIRA story number).
